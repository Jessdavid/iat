Development Workflow for Beginners:

LSD:

Logic, Syntax, Data

If something isn't wrong with your logic, then it'll be your syntax, and if it's not your syntax it'll
be your data.  Follow this mode of planning to work out your functions.

How to Know What You're Doing - Hypothesis

Have a hypothesis and try to validate that hypothesis


Process:

1) Gather requirements - what is it that you need to do
2) Figure out what you need to know and prototype it
3) Plan what you're going to do
4) Execute the plan
5) Debug what went terribly wrong
6) Refactor

Sometimes starting from what you're trying to get to and working backwords works

Lexical Scoping

Provides context.  Child scope of a parent has access to it's parent but a parent can't see it's child.

Googling
  Use keywords + context

Callback

A function that is run in response to an event.  Callbacks give us the ability to register a behaviour.  Javascript is an event driven language.  It was written to have behaviours run in response to the app/ user doing something.

It is a function that is called when something completes.  It is usually asynchronous.
